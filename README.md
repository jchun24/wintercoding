WINTER WORKLOG BEGINNING


Create GitHub Repository - 25 min.
I had to re-create my account since I couldn’t log in to the old account. 


Shared the link via Canvas, uploaded fall R coding files.

Continuing to work with Real-world dataset - 2hrs 10 min. - Sat. Dec 2

Using the meteorites dataset, linked the file with visual studio code. 

Had this error when uploading the dataset to the code.

Checked whether these two files were in the same repository, and was not.

By doing head(meteorites), able to see that the dataset has been uploaded to the code. 

Did some basic explanatory data analysis on this new dataset - 30 min

First, the file is too big (450000 lines), so I needed a warning(50) to see the first 50 for any operations.

Other data analysis operations

This plot is not as helpful since there are some outliers that affect the graph significantly. If there are 45,000 counts, it is likely to have outliers anyways.
